# Jamuly.net
Development of Jamuly.net, a free service where Jamulus users can find and schedule jam sessions
Visit jamuly.net for more information.

Note: at this point it looks like this will probably become a feature of the website Worldjam.vip
Update: I haven't made the time for this, and https://musicianslounge.muziguide.com/ seems to have developed a similar idea independently - excellent!

Now I'm thinking, instead, of a phone app that constantly cruises servers (a la Jamulus Explorer) and buzzes in your pocket when somebody comes on a server that's within your own latency tolerance. One advantage to this approach is that it would remain anonymous. Another is that the app actually measures the latency through your own local network (using the phone's WiFi, but close enough for alerting purposes).
